A significant percentage of people have skin disorders at some time in their life, and in certain 
situations, symptoms worsen if not caught in the earliest stages. It was acknowledged that 
without a doctor's help, the general public occasionally had trouble detecting symptoms. 
Additionally, it was found that the majority of people see dermatologists relatively 
infrequently, with the majority never having done so in their lives. In light of this, it was 
decided that this project should focus on finding a solution to the issue. The approach for 
recognizing a skin problem from a snapshot of the symptom and proposing a doctor who treats 
that disease is the suggested solution.
